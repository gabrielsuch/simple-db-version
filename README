** SIMPLE DB VERSION **

A minimalist way of put your SQL scripts under version control.

Notice:

Before running any installation scripts, a database should be created like follows:

CREATE TABLE DB_VERSION (
       install_date TIMESTAMP,
       version NUMBER, 
       current_script NUMBER, 
       last_script VARCHAR(1000)
);

(ps: the table name and its fields should be exactly the same).
